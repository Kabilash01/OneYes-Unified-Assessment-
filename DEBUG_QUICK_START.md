2. ✅ `frontend/src/components/auth/Login.jsx` - Added 6 debug logs  
3. ✅ `frontend/src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` - Added 5 debug logs

## 🎯 What You Need to Do

### **1. Refresh Browser**
```
URL: http://localhost:5174/login
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R
```

### **2. Open Console**
```
Press F12
Click "Console" tab
Clear console (Ctrl + L)
✅ Check "Preserve log" (important!)
```

### **3. Try Login**
```
Email: test.student@example.com
Password: Test123!
Click "Sign In"
```

### **4. Watch Console**
You should see emoji logs like:

🎓 Redirecting to student dashboard...
```

## 📸 Share These Logs

**Copy everything from console and send it to me!**

The logs will show:
- ✅ If API request succeeds
- ✅ What data is returned
- ✅ If user/token are extracted
- ✅ If navigation is called
- ✅ If route protection is blocking

---

## 🔴 Possible Issues We'll Find

1. **API Response Issue** - Wrong data format from backend
2. **State Update Issue** - isAuthenticated not set to true
3. **Navigation Issue** - navigate() not working
4. **Route Protection Issue** - RoleBasedRoute blocking access
5. **Timing Issue** - Navigation happens before state updates

**The console logs will tell us which one it is!** 🎯
