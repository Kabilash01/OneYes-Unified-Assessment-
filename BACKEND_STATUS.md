## 🔧 How to Run

### Start Backend Server
```powershell
cd backend
npm run dev
```

The server will run on **http://localhost:5000** with auto-reload via nodemon.

---

## 📋 Environment Configuration

Your `.env` file is configured with:
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/unified-assessment
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production-12345
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

⚠️ **Important:** Change `JWT_SECRET` before deploying to production!

---

## 🧪 Test the API

### Using curl or Postman:

**1. Health Check**
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/
```

**2. Register User**
```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "Password123!",
  "role": "student"
}
```

**3. Login**
```bash
POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "password": "Password123!"
}
```

**4. Get Current User** (requires token)
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/auth/me
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

## ⚠️ Minor Warnings (Can be ignored)

**Duplicate Index Warnings:**
- `email` field in User model
- `assessmentId + studentId` in Submission model

These are benign warnings caused by defining indexes both in the schema and explicitly. They don't affect functionality.

**Winston Transport Warning:**
- Occurs during MongoDB connection errors
- Fixed once MongoDB is connected

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. **Frontend is Already Running**
- URL: http://localhost:5174/
- Ready to connect to this backend

### 2. **Create Your First User**
- Visit http://localhost:5174/signup
- Register as a student or instructor
- The backend will handle authentication

### 3. **Test Full Stack Integration**
- Login via frontend
- Create assessments (as instructor)
- Take assessments (as student)
