## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Notification Bell Not Showing
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify NotificationProvider is wrapped in App.jsx
- Verify admin routes include notifications route
- Refresh page

### Unread Count Not Updating
- Check Network tab for `/admin/notifications/unread-count` API call
- Verify backend server is running
- Check backend logs for errors
- Try manual refresh (F5)

### Emails Not Sending
**Issue:** Console shows "‚ùå Failed to send email"
- **Solution:** Check EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD in `.env`
- For Gmail: Use App-Specific Password (not regular password)
- Enable "Less secure app access" or use OAuth2

**Issue:** "EAUTH" error
- **Solution:** Email credentials are incorrect
- Verify EMAIL_USER matches EMAIL_FROM address

**Issue:** "ETIMEDOUT" error
- **Solution:** Check firewall/antivirus blocking port 587
- Try using port 465 with `EMAIL_SECURE=true`

### Notifications Not Appearing
- Check MongoDB connection
- Verify Notification model has correct indexes
- Check backend logs for notification creation errors
- Use MongoDB Compass to view Notifications collection

## üìä API Testing (Postman/Thunder Client)

```
GET http://localhost:5000/api/admin/notifications/unread-count
Headers:
  Authorization: Bearer <admin-token>
```
