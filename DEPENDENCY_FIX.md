# ðŸ”§ Dependency Fix - Student Module

**Issue:** Missing `react-hot-toast` dependency causing build errors  
**Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** âœ… FIXED  

---

## Problem

The new Student Module components were using `react-hot-toast` for notifications, but the existing project uses `react-toastify`. This caused import resolution errors:

```
Failed to resolve import "react-hot-toast" from "src/pages/student/SubmissionsPage.jsx"
```

---

## Solution

### Step 1: Install react-hot-toast (for compatibility)
```bash
npm install react-hot-toast
```

### Step 2: Update all new files to use react-toastify (for consistency)

Changed imports in the following files:
1. âœ… `SubmissionsPage.jsx` - Changed to `react-toastify`
2. âœ… `SubmissionDetailPage.jsx` - Changed to `react-toastify`
3. âœ… `EditProfileModal.jsx` - Changed to `react-toastify`
4. âœ… `ChangePasswordModal.jsx` - Changed to `react-toastify`
5. âœ… `ActivityLog.jsx` - Changed to `react-toastify`
6. âœ… `PerformanceStats.jsx` - Changed to `react-toastify`

**From:**
```javascript
import { toast } from 'react-hot-toast';
```

**To:**
```javascript
import { toast } from 'react-toastify';
```

---

## Result

âœ… All files now use `react-toastify` consistently with the existing codebase  
âœ… Build errors resolved  
âœ… Toast notifications work across all components  

---

## Note

The project already had `ToastContainer` configured in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
import { ToastContainer } from 'react-toastify';
import 'react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css';
```

So all toast notifications will display correctly without additional configuration.

**Status: âœ… FIXED - Ready to continue development**
